A small polyfill with zero-dependency that do just do one thing.

`npm install groupby-polyfill`

This is a hybrid package. It dose not import or export anything so both `require`
and `import` works.

This will conditionally polyfill global Object/Map with the missing groupBy
method using `??=` but I would recommend that you conditionally import it if it's
needed. See comp. table at MDN if you need this:

- [Object.groupBy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/groupBy)
- [Map.groupBy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map/groupBy)

Documentation and code example is in this links too.

## Usage

Just need to import it.

```js
import 'groupby-polyfill'
```
